SimpleWeb4j - A very Simple stack web (inspired by Spark).
==============================================

## Why SimpleWeb4j

My current way to create web application is angular.js on client size, with twitter bootstrap for css, and have json resources on server side.
So I want a very simple framework to help create this sort of web app.

It's why I created SimpleWeb4j, on server side, you can handle http request, in order to create quickly json services, and on client side create an angular.js app.
